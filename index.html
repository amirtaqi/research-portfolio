      I am an inventor or co-inventor on <strong>3</strong> patents / patent applications that are publicly
      visible and <strong>6</strong> additional filings in progress. Because several of these are still
      under review or confidential, the descriptions below focus on the <strong>technical themes</strong>
      rather than formal legal titles.

        <h3>Electrochemical Water Treatment Platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Patent work on <strong>flow-through electrochemical reactors</strong> and
          <strong>granular activated carbon electrodes</strong> that generate reactive oxygen species in situ
          for the degradation of organic contaminants and emerging pollutants. These inventions tie directly
          to my multiscale modeling and experimental work on ROS-generating electrodes and reactor design.
        </p>
        <p class="collab-note">
          Themes: electro-Fenton(-like) processes, porous electrode engineering, high-throughput flow reactors,
          and scalable architectures for decentralized water treatment.

        <h3>Ocean-Based CO₂ Removal &amp; Marine Electrochemistry</h3>
        <p>
          Inventions that integrate <strong>electrochemical ocean iron fertilization</strong>,
          <strong>alkalinity enhancement</strong>, and in some cases <strong>hydrogen co-production</strong>,
          enabling controlled nutrient release and quantifiable, durable marine CO₂ sequestration.
          These concepts are closely linked to my work on electrochemical ocean carbon removal reactors.
        </p>
        <p class="collab-note">
          Themes: marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR), electrochemical iron cycling, alkalinity management,
          and coupled MRV (monitoring, reporting, verification) frameworks.

        <h3>Advanced Energy &amp; Thermal-Fluid Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Patent activity in <strong>energy and thermal management</strong>, including hydrogen- and metal-based
          heat generation concepts and system-level designs that connect thermal-fluid science to batteries,
          electrochemical devices, and broader energy systems.
        </p>
        <p class="collab-note">
          Themes: heat-generating materials and systems, thermal management strategies for electrochemical
          devices and reactors, and integration with battery and grid-scale applications.
